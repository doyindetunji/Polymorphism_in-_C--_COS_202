# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a concept in object oriented programming(OOP) which refers to the ability of a function or an object to exhibit different behaviors based on how it is utilized. 

In C++, polymorphism manifests in two major forms:
- Compile time (static) polymorphism
- Runtime (dynamic) polymorphism

## Compile time (static) Polymorphism:
- This type of polymorphism occurs during the complilation phase, where the method or function to be executed is determined at compile time. 
- It's achieved through method/function overloading or operator overloading.

### Function Overloading:

### Operator Overloading:

## Runtime (dynamic) Polymorphism:
- This type of polymorphism occurs during the program's execution
- it is typically achieved through method overiding, using inheritance and virtual functions
